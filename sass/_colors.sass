// colors are named with http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color
// if two colors have the same name use darken and lighten
// What about colors that are really close? For example, #303030 and #292929 would both be named $mine-shaft. To keep your color variables from becoming too granular, if a color name is duplicated, then itâ€™s not worth having its own variable. Instead, use the built in Sass color functions. In the above example, you would use darken($mine-shaft, 2.5%) instead of #303030
